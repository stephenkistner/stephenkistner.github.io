    <h1>ðŸ‘‹<br>Hi Craig &amp; Jan</h1>

    <p class="big">I'm Steve, a person who thinks, dreams, and asks a lot of questions about our augmented future.</p>

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <p>Everything is connected. I want to be a part of Focus to meet inspiring people, clarify my sense of self &amp; values, and figure out how to use my work to enrich humanity.</p>
    <p>In return I can offer the fresh perspective and boundless optimism of a person taking the first steps on his journey.</p>

    <p class="big">Design is art is writing is thinking is making is being.</p>
