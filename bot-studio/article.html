        <p>And so I’ve spent weeks searching for bots, chatting them up, testing them, and probably <a href="#">annoying them</a> and their kindly developers. Here are some early observations and notes for what we’d like to do (and not do). Note that this post is looking at only Messenger bots.</p>
        <h2>This is a secondary header</h2>
        <p>As we consider where to take our bots, we here in the Bot Studio are working hard to better understand the bounds and opportunities of the major platforms, as well as the people who use them, in what context, and why they’d prefer chatting with a bot over some other activity.</p>

        <h3>This is another level of header</h3>
        <p>As we consider where to take our bots, we here in the Bot Studio are working hard to better understand the bounds and opportunities of the major platforms, as well as the people who use them, in what context, and why they’d prefer chatting with a bot over some other activity.</p>

        <p>Here's what happened:</p>

        <h2>This is an unordered list style</h2>
        <p>As we consider where to take our bots, we here in the Bot Studio are working hard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Testing an idea</li>
          <li>This is another thing</li>
          <li>Yet another interesting bullet</li>
          <li>As we consider where to take our bots, we here in the Bot Studio are working hard to better understand the bounds and opportunities of the major platforms.</li>
          <li>Not actually. Still not super long.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And so I’ve spent weeks searching for bots, chatting them up, testing them, and probably annoying them and their kindly developers. Here are some early observations and notes for what we’d like to do (and not do). Note that this post is looking at only Messenger bots.</p>

        <pre><code>.navitem {
    display: flex;

    margin: 0 30px 24px 0;
  }
  .navitem:hover .navlabel {
    text-decoration: underline;

        <p>And this is an Ordered List:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Testing an idea</li>
          <li>This is another thing</li>
          <li>Yet another interesting bullet</li>
